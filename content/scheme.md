Summary: First impressions of scheme

Never has there been such a large learning curve in a language for me. Scheme is a completely different paradigm for me, and well in general. my first interaction with an if statement went something like this:

(if (empty? lis)
	(display "empty list")
	(display "not an empty list")
)

WHAT?! why is there two statements inside of the if, why isn't there an else statement?. I was generally confused. Of course though after enough programming exercises it clicked. Everything is written as lists of one another. So instead of the syntax I was used to, where there needed to be an else statement, a function is passed as an argument to if as else instead.
