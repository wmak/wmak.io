given a manifest file, and a set of images will return the relative positions of
each capturing camera from one another. For example the follwowin two images
were taken by two phones beside each other. This one on the left: &lt;img alt="left
image" src="https://github.com/IrisConstruct/iris/blob/master/src/img/a.jpg?raw=true" /&gt;
and this one on the right: &lt;img alt="right
image" src="https://github.com/IrisConstruct/iris/blob/master/src/img/b.jpg?raw=true" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do i find which picture is which? Well they are very close to one another
so I then used this to my advantage to use opencv to find
the matching landmarks between the two images. It then returns the following
image. &lt;img alt="comparisons" src="http://wmak.io/images/iris.jpg" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have found the matching points in the two images I can find there
distances from the left side of the image. This then tells me there relative
positions. This is because the left camera will see the same landmarks further 
to the left and the right camera will see the landmarks further to the right.
This seems anti intuitive especially if you try moving your head left and right
while staring at an object you will see that on the left the object will appear
furhter to the right. The reason the code is the other way around is that images
are mirrored by the front camera phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there we have it, at the code will return a "matrix" of scores that are then
used by the backend code to crop and position an image or video:
&lt;code&gt;{'scrs': [{'ip2': u'192.168.0.5', 'ip1': u'192.168.0.5', 'score': 0.0}, {'ip2':
u'192.168.0.6', 'ip1': u'192.168.0.5', 'score': 65.76188568516939}, {'ip2':
u'192.168.0.5', 'ip1': u'192.168.0.6', 'score': -17.09808192707039}, {'ip2':
u'192.168.0.6', 'ip1': u'192.168.0.6', 'score': 241.95999999999995}]}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Erasure Code</title><link href="/erasure-code.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-02-14T21:43:00+01:00</updated><author><name>William Mak</name></author><id>tag:,2014-02-14:erasure-code.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Forward Error Correction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To first understand Erasure Code, one must first understand &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_error_correction"&gt;Forward Error
Correction&lt;/a&gt; code, which
erasure code is a type of. Forward Error Correction is commonly used to solve 
the issue of repairing data lost in a network transfer. This is done by sending 
a file with additional redundancy. A very simplistic example of Forward Error 
Correction is to send each bit of data three times and choose the most common 
occurrence of what is received aka "democratic voting" or "majority vote". For
example if the source bit was &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;, and after being sent an error occurred it 
could end up as &lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;But&lt;/strong&gt; with Democratic voting if the bit is sent three 
times then it would require it to fail at least twice in order for the receiver
to interpret the data incorrectly. Though simple to implement, this type of
Forward Error Correction is relatively... very terrible since this
implementation would take triple the bandwidth and only really allows the signal
to fail once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Erasure Code&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erasure code which is a type of FEC can take a message and encode it in such a
way so that the original message can be decoded even if parts of the message are
lost in transmission. Erasure code does this by treating the original message as
a set of k symbols. It then extends these symbols to a longer set of symbols n,
these are then the symbols transmitted. Which so long as k` of the symbols are
transmitted the original set of k symbols can be reconstructed. A great
example of this is Polynomial Oversampling. If I wanted to transmit the symbols
'1020' I would do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Split the message into two parts ["10", "20"]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend the the message by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation"&gt;interpolating the
function&lt;/a&gt; so 
now the message might be something like ["10", "20", "30", "40"]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;transmit the message as something like "1=10", "2=20", "3=30", "4=40"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now on the receiving end&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the receiving side only receives 2 of the messages ie ["2=20", "4=40"]
these values too can be interpolated (ie f(i) = 10i)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using the resulting function the first two values can then be recalculated
so f(1)=10 and f(2)=20&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;now the original message can be reformed by joining the two values "1020"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now erasure codes come in varying degrees of efficiency, normally measured as 
k/n known as the code rate since the smaller this number is the less extra data 
needs to be transmitted. So with the Polynomial Overampling example above since
twice the number of symbols were generated it would have a rate of 1/2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also this other type or erasure known are rateless erasure codes of
fountain codes which has been covered
&lt;a href="http://mattolan.com/blog/the-basics-of-fountain-rateless-code.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; quite
well and which I will go over in a future post at some time along with the Go
implementation of it that is being put in place for the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/olanmatt/hermes"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Configuring Xmonad</title><link href="/configuring-xmonad.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-02-09T15:55:00+01:00</updated><author><name>William Mak</name></author><id>tag:,2014-02-09:configuring-xmonad.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So after having a bunch of wireless issues and poorly installing wicd on Linux mint I've decided to revisit using arch linux. I then spent a day fumbling around in arch until I finally had it running with &lt;a href="http://xmonad.org/"&gt;xmonad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://projects.haskell.org/xmobar/"&gt;xmobar&lt;/a&gt;. I've also posted my dotfiles on &lt;a href="https://github.com/wmak/dotfiles"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; if anyone else wants to configure their setup with them as well. Just note that I've added some keybindings for colemak but I think most of the qwerty bindings are still there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;xmobar&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having xmonad and xmobar start together actually took a long time to set up. Originally I had xmonad run xmobar itself as per the &lt;a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xmonad#Using_xmobar_with_xmonad"&gt;arch wiki&lt;/a&gt;. Which had xinitrc only need to run &lt;code&gt;exec xmonad&lt;/code&gt;, but because of a &lt;a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Frequently_asked_questions#XMonad_is_frozen.21"&gt;bug&lt;/a&gt; in xmonad if you change windows... or watch a video... or just use xmonad it will freeze up and become completely unusable. So instead I configured xmonad to leave a gap at the top of the screen and had xmobar run seperately. At first I tried having xinitrc do &lt;code&gt;exec xmonad | xmobar&lt;/code&gt; which seemed to work perfectly until I had to quit, at which point xmonad would completely freeze up and become unresponsive. In the end I figured I could run xmobar seperately in the background so the final xinitrc runs &lt;code&gt;xmobar &amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; right before executing xmonad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;xmonad&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently xmonad isn't configured all too much most of the default configs are perfect for me, but I set up the colours from a them I found on &lt;a href="https://kuler.adobe.com/Vintage-Color-color-theme-3369015/edit/?copy=true&amp;amp;base=2&amp;amp;rule=Custom&amp;amp;selected=0&amp;amp;name=Copy%20of%20Vintage%20Color&amp;amp;mode=hsv&amp;amp;rgbvalues=0.9411764705882353,0.2980392156862745,0.08627450980392157,0.8588235294117647,0.8588235294117647,0.8156862745098039,0.9294117647058824,0.7411764705882353,0.12156862745098039,0.2980392156862745,0.6901960784313725,0.611764705882353,0.19215686274509805,0.23137254901960785,0.2901960784313726&amp;amp;swatchOrder=0,1,2,3,4_"&gt;kuler&lt;/a&gt;, modified the layout to fit xmobar, and added some custom keyboard shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Scheme</title><link href="/scheme.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-02-05T06:43:00+01:00</updated><author><name>William Mak</name></author><id>tag:,2014-02-05:scheme.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Never has there been such a large learning curve in a language for me. Scheme is a completely different paradigm for me, and well in general. my first interaction with an if statement went something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(if (empty? lis)
    (display "empty list")
    (display "not an empty list")
)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT?! why is there two statements inside of the if, why isn't there an else statement?. I was generally confused. Of course though after enough programming exercises it clicked. Everything is written as lists of one another. So instead of the syntax I was used to, where there needed to be an else statement, a function is passed as an argument to if as else instead.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>First!</title><link href="/first.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-01-31T02:58:00+01:00</updated><author><name>William Mak</name></author><id>tag:,2014-01-31:first.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;)= no content yet&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
